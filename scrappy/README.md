This is the package of motivation.\
You must first install this package using following command 'npm i @chhabrabhishek/scrappy'.\
Then you have to require this package into a variable/constant.\
Eg. "const scrappy = require('chhabrabhishek/scrappy')".\
Now, everytime you'll call the scrapIt function, it will give you a new motivational quote on the console.\
Eg. "scrappy.scrapIt();" will give you "Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower. - Hans Christian Andersen".
